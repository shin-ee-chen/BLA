# BLA: a benchmark for Basic Language Abilities

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
BLA: a benchmark for Basic Language Abilities is proposed to explore the linguistic knowledge of pretrained vision-and-language models. The benchmark evaluates the models on their understanding of active-passive voices, coordination and sentences embedding a relative clause, three linguistic phenomena that are commonly used in English. And it proposes a framework to tease apart, as much as possible, linguistic vs. reasoning abilities of models and design the evaluation tasks more similar to the tests for humans.

## About
This project contains three folders: active-passive, coordination, relative clause. Each contains one task of the benchmark. The images are in folder 'images'. Check the "demo" files for statistics and examples on how to use the dataset.
